Http Client is used for Http requests and responses.
service is available in the @angular/common/http package
http service is included in the http client module which is used to initiate Http requests and responses in angular apps.
HttpClientModule  need to be imported in th module usually in the app module.
httpClient also gives the ability to use parameters, headers, interceptors, and other methods to control the request and responses.

Benefits of HttpClient
observables apis
can have headers in the options object
highly testable
typed request methods
resonse objects
reqest and response interception
are inert
CRUD

1. HttpModule is used for communcating between frontend app and backend apis/rest endpoints

2. HttpClientModule in out AppModule

3. We need to inject httpClient iin components/services and creates its instance in constructor

4. CRUD Operations
  creates
  edit
  update
  delete

5. Http methods
  post
  get
  put
  delete

6. Http for sending/configuring the headers that are sent.

7.HttpClient helps in creating Interceptors for api request.

8.HttpClient can be used for common error handling.

How to create an Observable with the constructor
An observable will start to emit its data as soon as an observer subscribes to it.

The observable will invoke the next() callback when a value arrives in the stream, passing this value as the argument to the callback.

If an error occurs, the error() callback is invoked. When the stream completes, the complete() callback is invoked.

Note that all three of these callbacks are optional.

Now that we know how it works, let’s create a simple observable as demonstration. We will use the main ‘app’ component.

so you c1. RxJS comes bundled with Angular when we install it, but we still have to include it in the component where we want to use it.
